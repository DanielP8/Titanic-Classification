# Titanic-Classification
This classification project uses a train/test split of the training data provided by https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview
There is no y-test data provided by default, so a train/test split on the training data provided was used, to provide a y-test to evaluate accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.

This project uses a pipeline including MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler and StandardScaler, alongside LogisticRegression, KNN, SVC and DecisionTreeClassifier models.
